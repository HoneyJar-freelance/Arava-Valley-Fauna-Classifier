# Arava Fuana Classifier (AFC)
## About
This is a copied repo from a project team I worked with from January - March 2023. The link to the original repo can be found here: https://github.com/HoneyJar-0/IQPMammalsC23.git

The project my teammates (Jason Rockmael, Lily Carleu, and Liam Hall) and I developed was for a degree requirement at Worcester Polytechnic Institute. Due to time constraints and other limitation, our final product was limited to just classifying jackals and foxes. 

With permission from our sponsor, Dr. Nitzan Segev, I have decided to continue the project. There will be many new features, and old, troublesome features will be deprecated without harming legacy code.

## Current Features
Currently, no changes have been made to the original software. This will change as time goes on.
1. Detection and classification of jackals, foxes, humans, other, nothing (~90% accurate)
2. CSV generation of predictions for connectivity to TimeLapse
3. Integration with MegaDetector

## Next Set of Features
1. Retrainable AI
2. Deprecation of MegaDetector and EcoAssist
3. CPU computation performance boost

Note: The reason I copied this repo rather than fork (which I originally did) was that I could not clean the dirty commit history on the fork for an unknown reason. Due the training data folder being pushed to the original repo, the .git folder was significantly larger than it should have been.
